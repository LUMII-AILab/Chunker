%%	alarm(+Time, :Callable, -Id, +Options) is det.
%	
%	Set up an alarm to be signaled Time seconds from now. If the
%	alarm expires, Callable is called asynchronously. Callable can
%	be used to raise an exception using throw/1 to abort some
%	execution.
%	
%	The alarm system manages a sorted list of scheduled alarms. Each
%	time an alarm is added, removed or expires, this list is
%	re-examined and a new signal is scheduled using setitimer()
%	
%	Options is a list of Name(Value) options.  Currently defined
%	options are:
%	
%		* remove(Bool)
%		If =true= (default =false=), remove the alarm-event (as
%		remove_alarm/1) after it has been fired.
%		* install(Bool)
%		If =false= (default =true=) do not install the alarm.
%		It must be installed seperately using install_alarm/1.

%%	install_alarm(+Id) is det.
%
%	Install an alarm allocated using alarm(Time, Goal, Id,
%	[install(false)]).  Typically used with call_cleanup/2:
%	
%	==
%		alarm(Time, Goal1, Id, [install(false)]),
%		call_cleanup((install_alarm(Id), Goal2),
%			     remove_alarm(Id)),
%	==

%%	remove_alarm(+Id) is det.
%	
%	Remove an alarm.  If it has not yet been fired, it never will.

%%	current_alarm(?Time, :Goal, ?Id, ?Status) is nondet.
%	
%	Enumerate the alarms in the schedule.  Time is the absolute time
%	the event is scheduled for (see also get_time/1). Goal is the
%	goal to execute, Id is the identifier and Status is the
%	scheduling status. It takes the value =done= if the alarm has
%	been fired, =next= if the event is the next to be executed and
%	=scheduled= otherwise.
