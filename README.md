USAGE
=====

After building, a dist\ folder will be formed; execute server_box.pl to start the demo service. On Windows machines, a browser should be started automatically, otherwise connect to localhost at port 88 with any web browser.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

A recent version of SWI Prolog is required; the relevant jpl (java-prolog interface) libraries must be available on system path.
Eclipse project files and Ant build scripts are included.
The build scripts assume that the morphological word analysis module (https://github.com/PeterisP/morphology) will be located next to this project (../Morphology)
